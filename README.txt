This is a tiny project I've been working to get an indepth idea of how neural networks and deep learning actually work.
For now, it is a tiny implementation of a "Hello, World!" neural network that seeks to implement basic handwriting recognition. (Digits, mostly).


Of course, the project is currently incomplete as I haven't completely understood the workings of neural networks (barely scratching the surface right now).

This public repository is only to serve as a backup of my work until I get something working and then maybe the code I've written might actually be helpful.
